Things to look at when deploying:-

flash-atten metadata generation failed (maybe bcz I don't have GPU in my personal laptop)
installed torch CPU version only
quantization 4 bits model(for dev) 6 bits for production (quantization can only be done in GPU)
login using the "huggingface-cli login" and provide the token to access the mistral model
